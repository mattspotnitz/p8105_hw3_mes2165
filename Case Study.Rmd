## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
nyc_airbnb
```

#load a dataset
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")
```
• How many rentals are there? what type and places?
•Is price correlated with review score?
•Which neigborhood is most popular?
•Which neighborhood has the highest reviews?
•Is availability related to price?
•Is room type rleated to neighborhood?
•IS length of stay realted to neighborhood group (borough)?
```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate (stars = review_scores_location/2) %>% 
  rename(borough = neighbourhood_group)
```

Let's try to count things
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(borough, room_type) %>% 
  pivot_wider (
    names_from = room_type,
    values_from = n
  )
```

Let's look at price and room type
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=stars, y=price)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(.~room_type)
```

Price and neigborhood
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  filter(borough == "Manhattan", price<=1000) %>% 
  mutate (neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>% summarize(mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% arrange(mean_price)

nyc_airbnb %>% filter(borough == "Manhattan", price<=1000) %>% 
  mutate (neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=neighbourhood, y=price)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() + facet_grid(. ~ room_type)
```

Price vs location
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  filter(price < 500) %>% 
  sample_n(5000) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=lat, y=long, color= price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5)  
```
